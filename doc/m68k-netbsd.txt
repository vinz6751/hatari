NetBSD Atari HW support history
-------------------------------

Atari HW supported by NetBSD is listed in wiki:
	http://wiki.netbsd.org/ports/atari/

              + anti-aliasing support

NetBSD releases before v7 are in archive:

v7.0 support ended in June 2020, rest are still supported.


Fetching NetBSD binaries
------------------------

Fetching NetBSD v8.1 binaries:

* Get TOS kernel loader "loadbsd.ttp":
	wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/installation/misc/loadbsd.ttp

* Get Hatari compatible kernel:
	wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/binary/kernel/kern-SMALL030.gz
	gunzip kern-SMALL030.gz
	mv kern-SMALL030 small030.bsd

* Get minimal install sets (base & config files):
	wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/binary/sets/base.tgz
	wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/binary/sets/etc.tgz
  (what the other sets are, is listed in the install manual.)

* Get installer floppy image:
	wget https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/installation/miniroot/sysinst.fs.gz
	gunzip sysinst.fs.gz

Full installation instructions:
	https://cdn.netbsd.org/pub/NetBSD/NetBSD-8.1/atari/INSTALL.html

(Atari instructions are not completely up to date, as they still
mention e.g. install floppies that seem to have disappeared in v3.0.)


Running NetBSD
--------------

0. Create empty hard disk image:
	atari-hd-image.sh 64 ide-64mb.img 

1. Start Hatari with the directory having the downloaded files:
	hatari --monitor vga --machine falcon --dsp none \
	--mmu on -s 14 --ide-master ide-64mb.img \
	--gemdos-drive z .

   Note: BSD seems to render correctly only with VGA monitor, and it
   needs an MMU. It won't boot on TT machine, most likely for the same
   reason it fails with Linux, due to missing SCU & VME emulation.

2. Run "loadbsd.ttp" from Z: drive and give "-b small030.bsd"
   as an argument

   You need "-b" option if you want kernel to ask for root drive,
   otherwise you can just drag the kernel file to TTP.


Issues
------

NetBSD v1.6.2, v2.1 and v8.1 all fail at boot, after recognizing
floppy and IDE, to "MMU fault" panic or trap 2.  Without '-b'
option, you end up in BSD kernel debugger.

NetBSD v9.0 outputs garbage to Atari screen, output will become
correctly visible only when kernel fails.
